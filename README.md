# KhoaVeyonService

**English** | [Tiếng Việt](README.vi.md)

A single Windows batch file that adds classroom-control actions to [Veyon](https://veyon.io): force close apps, block the internet (LAN stays on), allow only chosen sites, block chosen apps, lock down Task Manager and Settings, and mute the speakers.

Each action is a command-line switch, so every one can be run on its own from Veyon's **Run program** feature.

```
C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -blockall
```

> This is an independent script. It is not made by or affiliated with Veyon. It is **not** the paid *Internet Access Control* add-on from veyon.io; it is a free alternative built from Windows Firewall rules.

## Features

| Feature | Switch |
|---|---|
| Force close all open apps | `-killapp` |
| Force close all apps except a list you choose | `-keepapp` |
| Block all internet, keep LAN and Veyon working | `-blockall` |
| Block the internet except sites listed in an Excel file | `-allowpage` |
| Allow all internet again | `-allowall` |
| Block apps or folders listed in an Excel file | `-blockapp` |
| Unblock those apps again | `-unblockapp` |
| Disable Task Manager and Settings/Control Panel | `-lockdown` |
| Enable them again | `-unlock` |
| Mute / unmute the speakers | `-mute`, `-unmute` |

Other points:

- One file, no compiled code, no third-party tools.
- Excel is **not** required on the PCs. The `.xlsx` lists are read directly.
- No admin password is stored anywhere in the script.
- Designed for a classroom of standard (non-admin) student accounts.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 on the student PCs (Windows PowerShell 5.1, built in).
- Veyon installed on the teacher PC and the clients. The actions are started with Veyon's **Run program** feature.
- **Windows Defender Firewall switched on**, with its service (`mpssvc`) running. The internet blocking works by adding firewall rules, so it does nothing if the firewall is off.
- Student accounts without administrator rights.
- The script must be installed in `C:\cmd` on every client.
- Port 11100 open on every client (run `firewall-setup.bat` on each client first).
- One-time admin approval on each PC (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Installation

**Order matters: set up the firewall on each client first.** Veyon Master can only reach a student PC once port 11100 is open on it. After that, the rest is done from the server (the teacher PC where Veyon Master runs).

Files in this project:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `firewall-setup.bat` | Turns the firewall on and opens Veyon's port 11100. Run on every client **first**. |
| `KhoaVeyonService.bat` | The main script with all the actions. |
| `AllowPage.xlsx`, `BlockAppList.xlsx`, `KeepAppList.xlsx` | Optional lists (see [Excel list files](#excel-list-files)). |

### Step 1: Firewall on each client (first)

Copy `firewall-setup.bat` to the student PC (USB drive or a shared folder) and run it. Windows asks for the PC's admin name and password (UAC). It runs only these two commands:

```
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Veyon Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=11100 profile=any
```

This needs admin rights, so Veyon cannot do it for you. Do it once per PC. After it, check that the PC shows up in Veyon Master.

On the **teacher PC**, also allow port `11400` for Veyon's Demo feature. These are Veyon's default ports; use your own numbers if you changed them. No port forwarding is needed.

### Step 2: Distribute the files from the server

On the teacher PC, open Veyon Master, select the student PCs and use Veyon's file distribution (the **File transfer** feature) to send these files:

- `KhoaVeyonService.bat`
- the Excel list files you need

Veyon saves the files in the destination folder set for file transfer, which may not be `C:\cmd`. If your Veyon version has a destination folder setting, set it to `C:\cmd`. Otherwise send the files, look at one client to see where they landed, and move them into `C:\cmd`. The script must end up in `C:\cmd`.

### Step 3: Install on each client (once)

Run this on each client with admin rights:

```
C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -install
```

Windows asks for the admin name and password (UAC). You should see `Install done`. Veyon cannot do this step either, because its programs run as the student, who has no admin rights.

`-install` does two things:

- It creates one small Windows service per admin-level action (`KhoaVeyonService_blockall`, `_allowpage`, `_allowall`, `_blockapp`, `_unblockapp`). Standard users may **start** these services but not edit them.
- It makes `C:\cmd` read-only for normal users, so students cannot change the script or the lists, **except** `C:\cmd\log`, which stays writable so the activity log can be recorded as the student.
- It registers a logon task (`KhoaVeyonAutoLog`) that starts activity logging automatically for whichever student logs in (see [Activity log and export](#activity-log-and-export)).

### Step 4: Start applications from the server

From now on everything is done from Veyon Master on the server. Add an entry per action in Veyon (see [Adding the actions to Veyon](#adding-the-actions-to-veyon)), select the student PCs, and use **Run program** (called **Start application** in some versions) to start `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat` with a switch such as `-blockall`.

To update the script or the lists later, repeat Step 2 from the server. Because `C:\cmd` is read-only for students, you may need admin rights on the client to overwrite files that are already there.

## Switches

| Switch | Needs install? | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `-install` | - | One-time setup (needs admin). |
| `-uninstall` | - | Removes the services, firewall rules and app blocks. |
| `-killapp` | No | Force closes all apps in the logged-in user's session. Windows shell, Veyon, cmd and PowerShell are never closed. |
| `-keepapp` | No | Same as `-killapp`, but keeps the apps listed in `KeepAppList.xlsx`. |
| `-blockall` | Yes | Blocks all internet. LAN, localhost and Veyon keep working. Blocks IPv6 internet too. |
| `-allowpage` | Yes | Blocks the internet except the sites in `AllowPage.xlsx` (and the PC's DNS server). |
| `-allowall` | Yes | Removes the internet block. |
| `-blockapp` | Yes | Blocks the files or folders in `BlockAppList.xlsx` from running and closes copies that are already open. |
| `-unblockapp` | Yes | Removes those blocks. |
| `-lockdown` | No | Disables Task Manager and Settings/Control Panel for the logged-in user. |
| `-unlock` | No | Undoes `-lockdown`. `-unlockdown` also works. |
| `-mute` | No | Mutes the default speakers. |
| `-unmute` | No | Unmutes them. |
| `-activitylog-start` | No | Starts recording the active window title, process name, date, time, user and PC name to a CSV file. **Does not record keystrokes, typed text, or passwords.** |
| `-activitylog-stop` | No | Stops recording. |
| `-exportlog` | No | Merges this PC's activity log and action log into one CSV file, ready to collect and open in Excel. |

> **About `-activitylog-start`:** this is intentionally limited to *which window/app was active and when*, not what was typed. Recording keystrokes on children's computers is a serious privacy risk and this project does not include that capability. Tell students and parents that activity is recorded, in line with your school's policy.

Run with no switch (or an unknown one) to print the usage line.

The internet block stays in place after a reboot until you run `-allowall`.

## Full logging coverage

Every switch now writes a log line, from student-triggered actions (`-killapp`, `-keepapp`, `-lockdown`, `-mute`...) through to admin-level actions (`-blockall`, `-blockapp`...) and `-install` / `-uninstall` themselves. Nothing runs silently.

Each line records:

```
<date> <time>  PC=<computer name>  Student=<logged-in student>  RunAs=<account the code executed as>  [<switch>]  <message>
```

- **`Student`** is always the person actually sitting at the keyboard, resolved from the active console session — even when the action itself runs as SYSTEM (the admin-level switches) or as a different admin account (`-install` / `-uninstall`).
- **`RunAs`** is the account the code executed under (the student account for user-session switches, `SYSTEM` for admin-level switches run through the service, or the admin account used for `-install`/`-uninstall`).

This means a single log line always tells you *which PC*, *which student was there*, *what ran it*, and *what happened* — the full chain from student input to the admin-level action it triggered.

## Activity log and export

Everything lives in `C:\cmd\log` on each client, one CSV file **per PC per day**:

```
C:\cmd\log\activity_<PCNAME>_<yyyy-MM-dd>.csv
```

Columns: `Date, Time, PCName, User, Window, Process, Event`. `Event` is one of:

- `change` — the active window/app changed.
- `autosave` — an automatic row written every 3 minutes, so the file is never more than 3 minutes out of date, even with no change.
- `action` — a block/allow/app-block/etc. event merged in from the action log, in the `Window` → left blank and the detail placed under `Event` (e.g. `action: Internet BLOCKED`).

Rows are only ever **appended**, never overwritten, so the file accumulates through the whole day. At midnight the worker switches to the next day's file by itself, with no restart needed.

### Starts automatically when the PC turns on

`-install` registers a scheduled task (`KhoaVeyonAutoLog`) that fires at every logon, for any student account, and runs `-activitylog-start`. You do not need to add anything to Veyon for this to work; it runs on its own from the moment a student logs in. `-activitylog-start` does nothing if it is already running on that PC, so a double logon or a manual run afterwards is harmless.

### `-exportlog` (optional, manual)

The 3-minute `autosave` rows already keep today's file current on their own. `-exportlog` is only useful if you want the latest block/allow/app-block events merged in **right now**, without waiting up to 3 minutes. It is safe to run repeatedly; it only adds the lines it has not merged yet.

### Collecting the files

Use Veyon's file transfer (download direction, if your version supports it) or copy `C:\cmd\log\activity_*.csv` from each client. Every file opens directly in Excel; no `.xlsx` conversion is needed.

## Excel list files

Create these in `C:\cmd`. Use **column A of the first sheet**, one entry per row. A header row is fine (it is ignored if it does not look like a site or path). Only `.xlsx` files are read.

### `AllowPage.xlsx`

Sites to allow when you use `-allowpage`:

```
Site
wikipedia.org
vietjack.vn
```

`https://`, paths and `www.` are handled for you.

### `BlockAppList.xlsx`

Full paths of programs or folders to block with `-blockapp`. Wildcards and environment variables work:

```
Path
C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
C:\Games\*.exe
C:\Users\Public\Games
```

Anything inside `C:\Windows`, the Veyon folder, `C:\cmd` and drive roots is skipped on purpose, so a typo cannot break the PC.

### `KeepAppList.xlsx`

Apps that `-keepapp` leaves open. Use a program name, with or without `.exe`, or a full path:

```
App
chrome
mathgame.exe
C:\Games\KidsLearning
```

### Changing the list folder

By default the lists are read from `C:\cmd\`. To use one shared copy for every PC, change `LISTDIR` near the top of the script to a network path (keep the trailing backslash). The share must be readable by the computer accounts (for the admin-level actions) and by the student accounts (for `-keepapp`).

Because `-install` makes `C:\cmd` read-only for normal users, you update the lists as an administrator.

## Adding the actions to Veyon

1. Open **Veyon Configurator** and go to **Programs & websites** (the name varies by version; in older versions it is under **Master**).
2. Add one entry per action. The command is the script path plus the switch:

| Name | Command |
|---|---|
| Close all apps | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -killapp` |
| Close all except list | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -keepapp` |
| Block internet | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -blockall` |
| Allow listed sites only | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -allowpage` |
| Allow internet | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -allowall` |
| Block apps | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -blockapp` |
| Unblock apps | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -unblockapp` |
| Lockdown | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -lockdown` |
| Unlock | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -unlock` |
| Mute | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -mute` |
| Unmute | `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -unmute` |

3. Click **Apply**.
4. In **Veyon Master**, select the student PCs, click **Run program** (called **Start application** in some versions), and choose an entry.

## How it works

Veyon's **Run program** starts a command as the logged-in student, who has no admin rights. Changing the firewall needs admin rights, so the script uses two paths:

- **Admin-level actions** (`-blockall`, `-allowpage`, `-allowall`, `-blockapp`, `-unblockapp`): when started by a student, the script asks the matching SYSTEM service to run. The service starts the same script, which now has admin rights and does the work with PowerShell.
- **User-level actions** (`-killapp`, `-keepapp`, `-lockdown`, `-unlock`, `-mute`, `-unmute`): these run directly in the student's session and need no admin rights or service.

Details:

- **Internet blocking** adds two outbound firewall rules, `KhoaVeyonBlock` and `KhoaVeyonBlock6`. They block every address except private LAN ranges (`10.x`, `172.16-31.x`, `192.168.x`), localhost, link-local, multicast and broadcast.
- **`-allowpage`** looks up the IP addresses of each listed site and removes them from the blocked ranges. The PC's DNS servers are allowed as well.
- **`-blockapp`** adds a *deny Execute* permission for the Users group on each listed file or folder, and records the paths in `blocked.txt` so `-unblockapp` can undo it.
- **`-lockdown`** sets the `DisableTaskMgr` and `NoControlPanel` policies for the current user.
- **`-mute`** uses the Windows Core Audio API to mute the default output device.

The PowerShell code lives at the end of the `.bat` file, after the `#PS1START` marker. Do not put that text anywhere else in the file.

## Limitations

- **`-allowpage` works by IP address, not by domain.** Large sites that use many domains or CDNs (for example YouTube or Google) may load only partly, and IP addresses change over time. Run `-allowpage` again to refresh them. For reliable site filtering, use a DNS filter at your router.
- **A proxy server on your LAN defeats the block.** If the PCs reach the internet through a proxy with a LAN address, that traffic looks like LAN traffic and is allowed. Check with `netsh winhttp show proxy`.
- **Third-party firewalls and antivirus products** that manage the Windows firewall can override the rules.
- **Existing connections** may survive for a moment. Closing and reopening the browser makes the block visible immediately.
- **`-blockapp`** also affects administrators until you run `-unblockapp`. It does not block Microsoft Store (UWP) apps. A student can still copy a blocked program to another location.
- **`-lockdown` and `-mute`** apply only to the logged-in account. Students can still unmute with the keyboard volume keys.
- **Windows may log "service did not respond" (error 1053)** for the services. This is expected: the services are not real service programs, but the commands still run.
- Domain names and paths are processed from the first sheet only.

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens.**
Check the log. Admin-level actions write to `C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.log`; user-level actions write to `%TEMP%\KhoaVeyonService.log` of the logged-in student. The log records each action, missing list files and skipped paths.

**`Service not installed`.**
Run `-install` as the PC's administrator.

**The internet is still reachable after `-blockall`.**
Check, in this order:
1. The firewall is on: `netsh advfirewall show allprofiles state`
2. The rule exists: `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="KhoaVeyonBlock"`
3. There is no proxy: `netsh winhttp show proxy`
4. `ping 8.8.8.8` fails after the block, while `ping <teacher PC IP>` still works.

**A PC disappears from Veyon Master after the firewall was turned on.**
Add the incoming rule for port 11100 (see [Step 1](#step-1-firewall-on-each-client-first)).

**`-mute` does nothing.**
Make sure the PC has an active output device. Check the log for the error text.

## Uninstall

Run as administrator on each PC:

```
C:\cmd\KhoaVeyonService.bat -uninstall
```

This removes the internet block, the app blocks and the services. You can then delete `C:\cmd`. `-lockdown` and `-mute` are per-user settings, so run `-unlock` and `-unmute` as the student if they are still active.

## Security notes

- The script contains **no passwords**. Admin rights are provided once, at install, through the Windows UAC prompt.
- The services run the script as SYSTEM, so anyone who can edit `C:\cmd` could run commands as SYSTEM. That is why `-install` makes the folder read-only for normal users. Keep students on standard accounts and do not give them write access to this folder.
- Tell your students and their parents that the classroom tools can restrict the PC, in line with your school's policy.
